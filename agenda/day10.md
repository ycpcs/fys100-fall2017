# Agenda

We will be working on [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html), in which we experiment with melodies.

## Get ready

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

There are two things you should do.

First, create a document in your shared Google Drive folder called **MusicCompositionPlan**.  In it, write

* What style of music composition you are creating
* What kind of mood or feelings you would like to evoke
* What type of instrument sounds you plan to use
* What you think the structure of your composition will be (i.e., ABACAB), and what the parts will sound like

(Note: since we are posting this agenda late, it is OK if you don't have the content of this document completely filled in by the beginning of class.  However, please do create the document and start working on it.)

Second, read through the description of [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html).
