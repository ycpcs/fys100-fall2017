# Agenda
Day 16 is our discussion on Ubiquitous and Pervasive Computing. We will read two major articles that founded the field nearly 30 years ago. Scientists and academics often make many predictions about the future and not all of them come true. We will discuss to what extent Weiser's vision of pervasive computing has come to pass. 

Please read the following articles to prepare for today's discussion:
* Weiser91: [The Computer for the 21st Century](http://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf), Scientific American. 1991
* Weiser93: [Some Computer Science Issues in Ubiqiutous Computing](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring99/cs598c/papers/p75-weiser.pdf). Communications of the ACM. Volume 36. Issue 7. 1993.

Note: The Weiser93 article is aimed a technical audience and I do not expect you to understand every detail. However, given the embedding of technology in daily life, you should be familiar with most of the terms and issues discussed.
