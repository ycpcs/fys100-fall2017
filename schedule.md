title: "Schedule"

This page lists the schedule of topics, readings, and assignment due dates for the course.  This schedule will be updated throughout the semester: any changes will be announced in class and on the course website.

For class meetings where a reading is listed, make sure you have done the reading *before* you come to class.  Also note that there are suggestions regarding when to start some of the readings.

The agendas for each day will include some notes about the day's topic and activity, and may also include discussion questions.  Please read each agenda before you come to class.  Keep in mind that the agenda will usually include things you need to do to prepare for the day's activity: these will be indicated with the following "get ready" graphic:

It is very important that you do all of the "get ready" tasks before you come to class!
